Maze game presents a fame where the player moves through a maze searching for the exit. The maze grids are randomly generated using theseus, a maze generator (from https://github.com/jamis/theseus.git).

It currently displays a Text UI using Unix curses. As it only runs on Unix-like systems, I added a basic implementation of the curses library for jRuby using the Java/Swing GUI layer, so that it can run on all systems. The curses support is limited to make the game run and is not 'curses' compatible. I published it as a gem (https://github.com/jeanlazarou/jruby_curses).

The player can:
 * save the current maze and replay it at a later time,
 * load a demo maze (10 by 10), start the game with -d option,
 * force the generation of a new maze at any moment,
 * start the game with a timer
 
To run the game you need to first install theseus, then with RMI 1.9.2:
  $ ruby maze_game.rb
  
With jRuby:

Install the "jruby_curses" gem (see above) and then use it as
  $ jruby --1.9 maze_game.rb
 
Note:
Unfortunately, both RMI 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 did not include 'curses' after installing them with rvm, I managed to make it work by copying the 'curses.so' from 1.9.1 to 'lib/ruby/1.9.1/i686-linux'.
